# log4javascript
this is a fork of the orginal code laid out here: http://log4javascript.org/

While I like the API and the general concept of log4jjavascript. I find that the code is not particularly modular and it's size is too big.  So my goal here it so create a version of log4javascript which has submodules. This means that if you don't need some of the heavier weight appends you need not include them in your code
